# About

This is an HTML-only project that I completed while walking through John Smilga's HTML/CSS tutorial video (available here: https://www.udemy.com/user/janis-smilga-3/). 

Since this is an HTML-only project, it's certainly a simple and incomplete website. It's safe to say that it created with just one goal in mind: helping the user learn a little more about what exactly HTML does!
