# About

This is an HTML-only project that I completed while walking through and learning with John Smilga's HTML/CSS tutorial (at https://www.udemy.com/user/janis-smilga-3/). Since it's an HTML-only project, it's a very simple and incomplete website that was created with one goal in mind: helping the user learn a little more about what exactly HTML does!
